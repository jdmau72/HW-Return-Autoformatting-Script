# HW Return AutoFormatting Script

Script created for the Xtant hardware team to automatically format tray return sheets. 

Sets up the necessary columns and generates conditional formatting for ${\textsf{\color{red}FAIL}}$, ${\textsf{\color{grey}MIA}}$, and ${\textsf{\color{green}FAIL}}$ statuses, as well as formatting for ${\textsf{\color{yellow}Lot Adjustments}}$. 

Creates borders between different item numbers to group together lots of any given item.
